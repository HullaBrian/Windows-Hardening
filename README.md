# Project Overview
Windows-Hardening is a repository of Windows hardening knowledge/documentation.

In each of the top level directories for this project, you can find an array of categories for Windows hardening, including:
- General documentation for configuring and securing Windows machines and Active Directory networks
- Sysmon configuration
- Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for Active Directory and Standalone (local) environments
- Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) Policies
- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) filters

I will eventually add much more documentation to this project, it just takes a while!
