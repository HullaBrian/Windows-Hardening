# Documentation
This section provides various pieces of information regarding the
"how to" side of windows hardening rather than the pre-made templates
like WDAC policies and GPOs. As items are added to the documentation
within this repository, I'll do my best to make a general "tree" here
with everything in it so it's a bit easier to find things.

- AD-Security
    - LDAP Channel Binding
    - LDAP Signing
- DNS
    - Auditing DNS Entries
    - Restricting DNS Entry Permissions
